# Lorax World --- EDAN35 Project

This project was created as part of the course **EDAN35 -- High
Performance Computer Graphics** at Lund University.\
Our goal was to build a small interactive 3D environment inspired by
**The Lorax** using WebGL and custom shaders.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1.  **Install Node.js (version 20.19+ or 22.12+)**\
    Download from: https://nodejs.org

2.  **Install dependencies**\
    Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**

    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch Vite and open the project at:

        http://localhost:5173

4.  **Build for production (optional)**

    ``` bash
    npm run build
    ```
